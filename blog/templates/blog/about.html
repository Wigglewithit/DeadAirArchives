  <h1>Who I Am</h1>

  <p>
    Hey there — I’m a developer, builder, and deep thinker. This space is where I share what I’ve learned, what I’m creating, and where I’m heading next.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, I’m immersed in software development and game development — two fields that push my curiosity and challenge me to build tools that matter. I also enjoy working on games when time allows.
  </p>

  <p>
    But this journey isn’t all code and pixels. I’m also a full-time student, a dad of two, and someone making a serious career pivot at 34. It’s demanding, sure — but every step forward is worth it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Originally from Kentucky, I returned to school later in life. The transition hasn’t been easy, but it’s been meaningful. Growth takes grit.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ll be updating this section as I grow, learn, and create — both for myself and for others walking a similar path.
  </p>
