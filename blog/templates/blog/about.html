  <h1>ðŸ‘¤ Who I Am</h1>

  <p>
    Hey there â€” Iâ€™m a developer, builder, and deep thinker. This space is where I share what Iâ€™ve learned, what Iâ€™m creating, and where Iâ€™m heading next.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, Iâ€™m immersed in software development and cybersecurity â€” two fields that push my curiosity and challenge me to build tools that matter. I also enjoy working on games when time allows.
  </p>

  <p>
    But this journey isnâ€™t all code and pixels. Iâ€™m also a full-time student, a dad of two, and someone making a serious career pivot at 34. Itâ€™s demanding, sure â€” but every step forward is worth it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Originally from Kentucky, I returned to school later in life. The transition hasnâ€™t been easy, but itâ€™s been meaningful. Growth takes grit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iâ€™ll be updating this section as I grow, learn, and create â€” both for myself and for others walking a similar path.
  </p>
